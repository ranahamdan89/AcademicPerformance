• Conducted comprehensive analysis on dropout trends and contributing factors to enhance student retention strategies.
• Executed exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, feature evaluation (correlation matrix, odds ratio), model optimization, and data visualization.
• Developed predictive models using supervised machine learning algorithms including neural networks, logistic regression, and CART, with an 80%-20% train-test split.
• Achieved a predictive accuracy of 92%, facilitating early intervention and targeted retention initiatives.
